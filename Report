📄 Project Report: Movie Recommendation System
🧾 Project Title:
Movie Recommendation System Using Collaborative Filtering and Matrix Factorization

📚 Dataset Used:
Dataset Name: MovieLens 100K

Source: GroupLens Research

Format: 100,000 ratings by 943 users on 1,682 movies

Access: Loaded directly via URL without manual download

🎯 Objective:
The main goal of this project is to develop an intelligent recommendation engine that suggests movies to users based on their historical preferences and rating behavior. By analyzing patterns in the MovieLens 100K dataset, we aim to provide personalized movie recommendations using three key techniques:

User-Based Collaborative Filtering

Item-Based Collaborative Filtering

Matrix Factorization via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

🧰 Tools & Technologies:
Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Pandas – data loading and manipulation

NumPy – numerical operations

Scikit-learn – similarity computation and metrics

SciPy – matrix factorization using svds

🔍 Methodologies:
1. User-Based Collaborative Filtering
Approach: Compute pairwise cosine similarity between users based on their movie ratings.

Process:

Construct a user-item matrix with ratings.

Calculate cosine similarity between users.

Recommend movies highly rated by similar users but not yet seen by the current user.

2. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
Approach: Recommend movies similar to those the user has already rated highly.

Process:

Transpose the user-item matrix.

Calculate item-to-item cosine similarity.

Score unrated items based on similarity to rated items.

3. Matrix Factorization (SVD)
Approach: Decompose the user-item matrix into latent user and item features using SVD.

Process:

Fill missing ratings with zeros.

Apply truncated SVD to reduce dimensions.

Reconstruct the matrix and recommend top unseen movies with highest predicted ratings.

📊 Evaluation:
🔸 Metric: Precision@K
Definition: Measures how many of the top K recommended movies are actually relevant (i.e., match user’s preferences).

Usage: Used to assess the accuracy and quality of recommendations.

📈 Visual Analysis (Optional):
Ratings distribution plotted to understand the popularity of different ratings.

Bar chart of most-rated movies to identify globally popular items.

Heatmap of user-user similarity to visually explore relationships in user behavior.

Scatter plot of predicted vs. actual ratings for model validation.

🧪 Sample Output:
For a given user (e.g., user_id = 10), the system outputs:

A ranked list of N recommended movies that the user hasn’t rated before.

Recommendations differ by method used (User-Based, Item-Based, SVD).

✅ Results & Conclusion:
User-Based filtering works well when users with similar behavior exist in the dataset.

Item-Based filtering tends to perform better in sparse environments since item similarities are more stable.

SVD provides strong personalized predictions by learning hidden patterns in the data.

Each approach has its strengths, and combining them (hybrid systems) may yield even better results.

🚀 Future Enhancements:
Use larger datasets (e.g., MovieLens 1M or 20M) for better generalization.

Implement implicit feedback (watch time, clicks) in addition to explicit ratings.

Add support for genre, tags, or content-based filtering.

Enable dynamic updates as new ratings are added.
