Project Title: Movie Recommendation System
Dataset Used: MovieLens 100K (loaded via URL)
Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SciPy

Objective:
To build a recommendation system that suggests relevant movies to users based on rating patterns using collaborative filtering and matrix factorization.

Techniques Applied:

User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Measures user similarity using cosine similarity and recommends based on ratings from similar users.

Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: Measures item similarity and recommends items similar to those the user liked.

Matrix Factorization (SVD): Applies Singular Value Decomposition to predict missing ratings and recommend unseen movies.

Output:
For a given user ID, the system recommends top N highest-rated movies the user hasn't seen yet.

Evaluation:
Precision@K metric can be used to evaluate how many of the recommended movies are relevant to the user.
